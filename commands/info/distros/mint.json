    "description": "• Not a recommended Linux distro due to providing little to no benefit over using an Ubuntu flavor and being generally more broken than Ubuntu and its flavors.\r\n• Uses a mix of their own repos and Ubuntu's repos to get things like the kernel from Ubuntu's repos instead of building their own kernel.  This could result in packages from Ubuntu's repos replacing packages that were installed from Mint's repos during upgrades which will most likely break things.\r\n• Has been known to mix Ubuntu and Debian packages, resulting in a [FrankenDebian](https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian#Don.27t_make_a_FrankenDebian).\r\n• Has been known to have issues with upgrading between releases.\r\n• Website has been hacked twice; one of these times resulted in malware being distributed in Linux Mint's ISOs.\r\n**Package manager**: `dpkg`    \r\n**Instead of using Linux Mint, we highly recommend using [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org).\r\nSee `sudo info recommended` for a list of recommended distros.**",
